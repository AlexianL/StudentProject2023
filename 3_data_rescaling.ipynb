{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data rescaling \n","----\n","Artificial neural networks work best when dealing with small value data. Some of our inputs in the ANN will be the proton and neutron numbers, which can go to values up to 200. This is why we need to rescale them, and we will do so in this notebook by rescaling them between 0 and 1. We will then separate the data into two different datasets (and thus two different .csv file) to create a training dataset and a test dataset for our ANN. It is needed to save also the data which has not been separated to be able to rescale back the values in the following notebooks.
